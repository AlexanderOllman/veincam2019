## Project Vision
VeinCam is a device that enables the visualisation of the superficial vein system, and its purpose is to a tool to be utilised in the education of the human body and its functions. The device is based on the [Venenfinder project](https://hackaday.io/project/26158-assistance-system-for-vein-detection) submitted during the 2017 Hackaday event, and a prototype was developed in 2018 to extend the Venenfinder to become smaller, portable, and simple to build by young students and inquisitive minds while being affordable

This Semester, the vision is to produce a marketable kit that remains affordable and convenient to sell to educators for construction and development within a class environment.  

### Value Proposition
Our VeinCam device will help students better understand venous sites by augmenting visualisation of upper limb veins. It will provide students with a better understanding of venous sites around the body compared to an image or model.

### Project Scope
This project aims to continue on the achievements of the team from last semester and make the device marketable. This will include the optimization of the device and its software, including the option of migrating to a new hardware platform and rewriting some aspects of the program's code.

Continuing on from this, we will reach out to suppliers and manufacturers for the quote, order and manufacture of specialised parts. In doing so, we can have a complete bill of materials, costing and supplier sheet for the client to then use for the order to create the kits.

#### VeinCam Core Features
The VeinCam project utilises similar hardware to the Venenfinder project (Raspberry Pi, PiCam, IR LEDs) and extends the software's capabilities to automatically adjust the infrared light filtration, brightness and contrast to produce the clearest image possible with limited manual adjustment. The device is smaller than the Venenfinder despite being battery powered and completely wireless.


#### Future Marketing and Procurement Plans
The device will receive optimisations to ensure it is the best product possible before going to market. Simultaneously, procurement options will be explored.

Several avenues will be explored in efforts to optimise the device. this will include new hardware options for consideration, as well as software implementations that may lead to a software rewrite if necessary (changing from one language to another). These options will be discussed as a team going forward before agreeing on the final optimisations.

## Resources
### Funding
Due to the researching nature of this project, there should be minimal costs for the projects. the only risk to this is the potential for the procurement of different hardware for testing, should it be deemed necessary by the team.

Regardless, a [Bill of Materials](#bill-of-materials) will be generated as these costs reveal themselves, and will be used to show what the procurement and research team member has arranged for component pricing with suppliers. Costing will be updated as this information comes to light.

### Tools

with the potential to continue development with componentry, the tools likely to be used throughout this project include:
- Soldering Iron
- 3D Printer
- Laser Cutter
- Dremel
- Screwdriver, screws, nuts and bolts.

All safety precautions outlined by the ANU Makerspace's Terms and Conditions will be followed during the use of instrument or tool, regardless of where and how it is used. A safety risk analysis has been performed at the bottom of this document.

#### Project Administration
* GitHub
* Google Drive
* Discord Communications Platform

#### Manufacturing and Testing
* Ian Ross Design Studio
* ANU Makerspace

##### Bill of Materials
An initial Bill of Materials has been drafted below of what we expect the project to cost.

| Component | Cost (AUD) | Supplied By Client |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| | | |
| | | |

Please note that component pricing is not finalised and is suitable for a quotation only. Manufacturing costs can vary with the price of raw materials as determined by the suppliers.

#### Programming
Source code from the last semester of development will be modified for the optimisation of the current platform, or rewritten if deemed appropriate. A snapshot of the code has been captured and archived within the [repository](/master/Software/Initial%20Code).

## Risk Analysis
All risk analysis performed throughout this project will be in accordance to the Australian and New Zealand Industry Standard AS/NZS 4360:2004.

![Risk Matrix](https://github.com/chrisbodger/VeinCam/blob/master/images/ConOps/risk-matrix.png)

Potential risks to the success of the project have been brainstormed in order to understand them and mitigate either their severity or likelihood.

| Risk | Consequences | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Not clearly understanding or defining client's requirements for the project. | Product does not meet client requirements, client dissatisfied, requires re-doing work, going over budget and schedule to redesign | D | 3 | Maintain regular contact with client regarding progress and milestone completion. |
| Not defining scope of project and setting clear and achievable milestones. | No clear definition of project progress, feature creep over time results in lack of physical product, no clear "stopping point" for project or completed product, client dissatisifed, product does not meet customer requirements, likely to be over-budget. | C | 3 | Defining scope early and ensuring we stick to milestones and their respective outputs to ensure we do not deviate on a project tangent. |
| Device cannot be utilized as a medical device due to not meeting medical certification criteria. | Unable to deliver product to medical professionals, which is client's ultimate goal for the project. | C | 2 | Ensure client is aware of potential certification issues, and that they verify during development whether the device can be used with and/or without the medical classification. |

### Safety Risk Analysis
In developing the prototype there is a chance of injury, similar to above these risks have been listed and steps taken to mitigate their severity or likelihood.

| Risk | Consequences | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Personal harm whilst using listed tools (incl. burns, shocks, cuts) | Pain, discomfort and possible medical attention. | D | 3 | Ensuring all team members are familiar with the safety training of the ANU Makerspace/Engineering workshop, supervision by one other team member when using potentially dangerous tools. |
| Damage to Hardware due to physical impact or electrostatic discharge (ESD) | Loss of data, hardware faliure, schedule delays to order and replace damaged hardware. | E | 4 | Ensuring hardware is never placed in an area where it is likely to be damaged, always in full visible sight. Observing proper ESD safety techniques, such as regularly grounding ourselves and only contacting circuitry by edges. |
