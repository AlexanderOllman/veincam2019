## Meeting Minutes Week 3 (12/03/2019) TO BE EDITED
Present:
Josh
Chris
Alex B
Alex O
Tom
Patrick W


Main points:
•	Greater depth in requirements necessary.
•	Josh hardware – off the shelf cases are too big and expensive. An acrylic (68x75x36) case looks to be a good option (with 3A+ battery). With keeping the Raspberry 0 platform, optimisation enclosure wise mightn’t be possible.
•	Potential for having two low/high power systems for purely education/interest use and more advanced used, respectively. Josh to put together prices to give an indicative price for both versions. Raspberry 0 and Raspberry A+ models decided to be looked at. Research materials and compare manufacture cases. Build a prototype of each. Deliverable to finalise designs to then do so.
•	Software- went through main python functions, java script etc. Have come up with questions for Alex O. Broad idea of how software works, just need clarification. Looking to cut down OpenCV library. Want to know where functions are coming from as there appear to be several classes that are unused; camera_base.py file. Purpose clarified by Chris. Aim to cut down on start-up time. Trace back histogram function to understand what it does. Do histogram equalisation and run more filters to enhance. Improve performance under different light conditions- IR close to 850nm begins losing performance due to inability to filter. Chris advised that not much can be done due to this filtering requirement. Increase frame rate. Photo-image processing. Stretch goal to clean up user interface-make it look a bit nicer and easier to use. Deliverable to understand software with Alex O help.
•	Emphasised by Alex O and Chris – must keep end goal of project in mind as to not run into the issue of last semester of wasting time/misdirection.
•	Audit-present a well structured project outline. Define project scope.
•	Keep a software and hardware diary for repository.

Reqs;
Decision-Log.md to be put in repository- only real decision was to look into two versions.
Gather relevant info. Source pricing. Present a kit version.

Goals for next week:
Pricing ready for hardware.
Software-get a good idea of software currently and where it wants to go.
ConOps and Requirements to be done.
Establish milestones (weekly etc) to keep project on track. Are we still following what was set out to be done.
