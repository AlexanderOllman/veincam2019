Below is the **first** revised version of last year's design requirements (*not final*).

1.	Compared to other devices with similar functionality, the produced device must be relatively inexpensive.
2.	The device must be simple to construct and easily reproduced.
3.	The device must be simple to use. Ease of use should be correlated with the intended educational application of the device, and as such be relevant for expected users.
4.	The device must be able to use near infrared (NIR) illumination and real-time image processing to make veins appear more visible. This criterion must be of a level of quality that is satisfactory for educational use.
5.	The device must be able to be handsfree.
6.	The device must be able to wirelessly connect to an external device with a screen.
7.	The device must be portable and mobile.
8.	The device must be reasonably easy to maintain, clean and fix in the event of failure/break/degradation.
9.	The device should display veins in as many use-cases as possible (e.g. dark-skinned, tattooed, hairy). (*Stretch deliverable*)
